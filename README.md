# DATA-1030Final-Project

This is the FInal Project for the Data1030 Fall2022. My project is about the CO2 Emission by the Vehicles. The aim is helping people to choose a better car
which can cause less CO2 in order to peotect the environment.

And in this project I use the RMSE because this is a linear regression data, so RMSE will be my evaluation matrics to compare with different models, such as
Random Forest, KNN, and so on.

And in this project, I go through the whole steps which are introduction of the project, EDA which is help us to know the data, Spliting/Preprocessing which
helps us to get further steps in cross validation. and I use tuning parameters to tune the models to reduce the RMSE. Also, I have outlooks for my project.

For further reading and coding you can see in my files and read them.
